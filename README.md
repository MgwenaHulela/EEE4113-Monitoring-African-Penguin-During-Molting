#  Automatic Monitoring of African Penguins During Molt

## Project Overview

This repository contains the design, implementation, and documentation of a modular system for **automated, non-invasive monitoring** of African Penguins (*Spheniscus demersus*) during their molting period. The system was developed as part of the EEE4113F course in the Department of Electrical Engineering at the University of Cape Town.

The system combines:
- **Load cell-based weighing platform**
- **RFID-based penguin identification**
- **Machine learning-based molting stage classification**
- **Environmental data logging (temperature and humidity)**
- **User-friendly web interface**

---

##  Objectives

- Develop a **non-invasive** monitoring platform.
- Track **individual penguin weight** over time.
- Classify **molting stage** using image analysis.
- Associate data with **RFID-tagged individuals**.
- Ensure **robustness** under harsh coastal conditions.
- Operate within a strict **R1500 budget**.
- Present data via a **simple user interface**.

| Electronics & Controls           | `software/embedded/` + `hardware/Load_Cell_Integration/` | Embedded code and electrical design |
| Molting Detection & UI          | `software/ml_model/` + `software/web_dashboard/` | ML training code,pipeline, Flask dashboard, database ,ML dataset and Models,validation results|
| Full System Integration & Docs   | `docs/` + `README.md`                    | Documentation and project coordination |

## ðŸš€ Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Arduino IDE for embedded development
- Python 3.x with:
  - `Flask`, `OpenCV`, `TensorFlow`, `sqlite3`, `Pandas`
- ESP32-CAM AND ESP32 dev board and RFID reader hardware
- Load cell and HX711 amplifier

### Setup Instructions

1. **Embedded Setup**
   - Flash `embedded/main.ino` onto the ESP32-CAM and ESP32.
   - Calibrate load cells via serial monitor.
   - Ensure RFID reader is functioning (check serial output).

2. **Run Web Dashboard**
   ```bash
   cd software/molting_detection_UI
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   python hi.py
